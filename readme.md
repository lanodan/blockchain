# BLOCKchain (not that kind)

This is a (probably hard) fork of dzuk’s controverted blockchain, feel free to send patches, this one should be much more like a wiki over git than anything.

## Documents
- [full list of instances](list/list.md)
- [deleted instances](info/deleted_instances.md)

## Tools
- https://instances.social/ : Where you can get the description and basic moderation policy when filled in by admins (opt-in, registeration, limited to mastodon-compatible)
- https://fediverse.network/ : Where you can get an instance metadata (pleroma is transparent on policies by default)

## Goals
- Get a list with the most of information about instances, while avoiding the “throw in there everything the author does not like” as much as possible.
- Try to give as much information as needed for moderation or general knowlegde, not just out of context quotes
- Try to be software independent (dzuk is writing it clearly as a mastodon user which didn’t use the fediverse before it existed)
- Illegal content is illegal depending on your jurisdiction. For example and sorry for this hard one: (Pro-)LGBT stuff is banned in Russia while anti-LGBT stuff is banned in EU/USA.

This will not be neutral, this will be very political, as in: Even my own opinion may not be the best one, do your own choices, this is there for facts and hopefully opinions about them from multiple sides.

If you have any doubts about an instance, *try to reach out before doing heavy actions such as blocking*, **please**.

## Non-Goals
- Any kind of automated blocking list, automate your software to block/replace words or warn moderators
- Any kind of information that you can already find publicly via their info pages or with the previously mentionned Tools.
- Legal advice for your own jurisdiction

## Contributions

Feel free to contribute by:
- email: `contact+github-blockchain@hacktivis.me`
- fediverse: `lanodan@queer.hacktivis.me`
- Github PRs

Unless it's really obvious how bad an instance is by looking at their front page, it's important that you bring evidence. Links are especially preferred becuase it means I can verify, archive and screencap them myself.
