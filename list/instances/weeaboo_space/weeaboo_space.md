### Not allowed
- Pornographic avatars (No I won't complain about half-naked anime girls, just keep nipples and genitals away)
- Untagged NSFW
- Continued, intentional and targeted bullying/spamming.
- Exiling/Threatening someone for their opinion. You're not obligated to listen, nor to care, but they still have the right to say what they want as long as their actions don't break any other rules. If you don't like someone, you block them and call it a day
- Nothing that's actually illegal. Like child pornography or unironic bomb threats

### Allowed
- Controversial opinions
- "Questionable jokes"
- Shitposting (But please stop spamming people if they ask. They should not have to ask multiple times)
- Most other things if not mentioned in the list of things we don't allow, just don't be an asshole

### Description
This is an invite-only instance focused on general discussion, but often anime or tech. Any subject is allowed on this instance as long as you don't break any of the rules. We support free speech as long as it does not elevate into direct threats.

We understand some might find this hard to moderate. But if you're an admin who absolutely must block for some reason. I urge you to at least block individual users and not the whole instance.
